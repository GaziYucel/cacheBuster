# Cache Buster

> :warning: **This is a development tool and should not be used on a live site.**

A plugin for [OJS, OMP and OPS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/) that will clear the CSS and template cache with every page load. This can be used to disable the cache when developing a theme or plugin, so that you can see your changes immediately.

Use the correct branch for your version of OJS, OMP and OPS.

| Software Version | Branch |
| --- | --- |
| Latest development | `main` |
| 3.4 | `main` (2023-02-28) |
| 3.3.x | `stable-3_3_0` |
| 3.2.1.x | `stable-3_2_1` |
| 3.1.2.x | `stable-3_1_2` |
